### What is this repository for? ###

This library give you a stack of functions to manipulate:
Vectors (with 2/3/4 different dimensions)
Matrixes (4 x 4)
But also lots of utilities functions
Every function in the library is documented in its .h file

### How do I get set up? ###

"Make" is the only thing you have to do to compile the library.
To link to the library you have to add this to your compile command line:
"-lrmath -L YOUR_PATH_TO_RMATH/ -I YOUR_PATH_TO_RMATH/includes/"
Rmath have dependencies with <math.h>, which should be installed by default on every distribution anyways

### How do I contribute? ###
You can:
Write test for the functions in the library.
Review the code to check if something could be done better.
Propose others usefull functions that should be here.
